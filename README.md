# Skybrush Studio for Blender Translations

This repository is the main source of translations for [Skybrush Studio for Blender](https://github.com/skybrush-io/studio-blender).

The structure of the repository is similar to the main [blender-translations](https://github.com/blender/blender-translations) repository.

## How to translate strings?

This repo is connected to Weblate, a cooperative translation frontend. Translation should be performed on the [Skybrush Studio for Blender translation website](https://translate.skybrush.io/projects/skybrush/studio/) accordingly, where all the languages supported by Blender should be listed.

## How to push/pull translations to/from Skybrush Studio for Blender?

Merging new translations with our add-on is done by the Skybrush team when new translations are mature enough for an update. If you wish to see your new translations in action, you can test the plugin with the following procedure:

1. Open Blender with the "Skybrush Studio for Blender" add-on loaded
2. Setup the "Manage UI translations" add-on properly in "Edit" / "Preferences" / "Add-ons":
    1. clone the `blender` and `blender-translations` sources from GitHub (`git clone --depth 1` is enough)
    2. link them to the "Source Root" and "Translation Root" directories
    3. save settings to a proper "Persistent data path" as settings might be lost on next Blender execution
3. In "Properties" panel / "Render" / "I18n Update Translation" press the "Import PO..." button under the "Add-ons" section:
    1. select this repository's `po` directory for the PO inputs/outputs
    2. wait for the translation add-on to import translations and automatically export them to the skybrush add-on's code.
    2. cut the auto-generated `translations_tuple` section in the `studio-blender` add-on from `ui_skybrush_studio.py` and replace the old version in `modules/sbstudio/i18n/translations.py` with the new one (search for the string `AUTOGENERATED I18N SECTION`).
